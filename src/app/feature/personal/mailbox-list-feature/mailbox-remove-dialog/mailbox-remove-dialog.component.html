    Deleting this mailbox is irreversible. Once deleted, all emails forwarded from aliases to that mailbox will no longer be accessible. Additionally, all aliases associated with the mailbox will be removed. However, you can always recreate a mailbox after deletion. Keep in mind that aliases won't be automatically restored.
