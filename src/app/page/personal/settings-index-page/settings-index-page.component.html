        <p class="opacity-70" i18n>
          Enabling two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account. After enabling 2FA, you will be required to enter a verification code from your chosen method in addition to your password every time you log in to your Alunea account. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.

          When you change your email address, your new email address will replace the current one associated with your Alunea account. Please note that your email address serves as your login for Alunea and is used to receive important service-related communications. However, changing your email address will not affect your mailboxes or aliases.
