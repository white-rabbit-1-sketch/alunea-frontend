                        What happens if I enable/disable a contact?

                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <p class="opacity-70" i18n>
                    If you temporarily disable a contact, sending messages to this contact will be paused, even if you're using their contact aliases. However, this won't affect receiving emails from this contact.

                        What happens if I delete a contact?

                <p class="opacity-70" i18n>
                    Deleting a contact won't have any immediate effect or restrictions. If an email is received from this contact, it will automatically recreate itself. Essentially, deletion is reversible. Keep in mind, this action automatically removes all contact aliases associated with removed contact.

                        What is a contact alias and how does it work?

                <p class="opacity-70" i18n>
                    A contact alias is a unique email address associated with a contact. When you send a message to a contact using their contact alias, the message is forwarded to their real email address without disclosing your own. This ensures privacy and confidentiality in communication.
